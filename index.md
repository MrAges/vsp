## Welcome to ViennaStockPoolÂ´s

Some time ago I started a small project in which I wanted to take a closer look at crypto currencies and finally got stuck with ADA (Cordana).
To support the community I built a Linux server out of old PC hardware and installed a Cordana node - which surprisingly took a lot longer than I thought;) The server is now running quietly behind me in the office and I hope that it will last for a longer time to be able to support the blockchain with it.
