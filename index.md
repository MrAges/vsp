## Welcome to the ViennaStockPool

Servus.

Some time ago I started a small project in which I wanted to take a closer look at crypto currencies and finally got stuck with ADA (Cordana).
To support the community I built a Linux server out of old PC hardware and installed a Cordana node - which surprisingly took a lot longer than I thought;) The server now runs quietly 24/7 in the office and is constantly being maintained and further developed. Together we will make a good contribution to the Cardano network and support this great technology.
